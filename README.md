# Project Atlas

**Home improvement project management that actually works.**

A purpose-built platform for managing home renovation projects with the clarity and control you needâ€”without the bloat of enterprise tools or the limitations of generic task apps.

## Live Demo

## Features

### Core Functionality

**Kanban Board** - Jira-style drag-and-drop task management across five workflow stages (Backlog â†’ Ready â†’ In Progress â†’ Blocked â†’ Done). Move tasks between columns, filter by project and priority, and add tasks directly from any column.

**Dashboard** - Real-time overview of all active projects with status tracking, recent activity feed, and quick access to tasks and milestones.

**Projects** - Organize work across multiple renovation projects. Each project tracks scope, timeline, budget allocation, and associated tasks with visual progress indicators.

**Calendar** - Month view of scheduled tasks and project milestones with filtering by project. Navigate between months and see deadlines at a glance.

**Budget Tracking** - Monitor project costs with expense categorization, actual vs. planned comparisons, and visual spending breakdowns.

**Documents** - Centralized storage and organization for contracts, permits, invoices, and project photos with search and category filtering.

### Interactive Features

- **Full drag-and-drop** task management with touch support
- **Real-time filtering** by project, priority, and status
- **Modal-based task editing** with inline validation
- **Cross-page data sync** using localStorage and pub/sub events
- **Responsive design** optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Keyboard navigation** with accessibility support (ARIA labels, focus management)
- **Contact form** with validation and beta signup

### Data Persistence

All changes save automatically to browser localStorage and sync across tabs in real-time. No backend requiredâ€”your data stays private and local.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5/CSS3** - Semantic markup, CSS Grid, Flexbox, custom properties
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** - No framework dependencies, ~1100 lines of interactive logic
- **localStorage API** - Client-side data persistence
- **Drag and Drop API** - Native browser drag-and-drop with custom styling
- **PHP** - Optional contact form processing (server-side)

## Philosophy

Project Atlas treats home improvement like the complex, interconnected system it is. The platform understands that you can't tile the bathroom until the plumbing rough-in passes inspectionâ€”and surfaces those blockers before you order materials.

Built for homeowners who understand good tooling but are frustrated with existing apps: too simplistic, too bloated, or clearly designed by people who've never installed subfloor.
